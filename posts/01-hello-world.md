### Transcript

**Espen:** I'm currently working three days a week with Hava Media on Phlinx, Releases, and DailyBits. The rest of my time I am available for hire. Recent clients include Smashing Magazine , Oslo Municipality, and VitusApotek (Lloyds Pharmacy, but in Norway). I sometimes talk about design at conferences around the world. 

**Vasilis:** I work as a lecturer at the University of Applied Science in Amsterdam, The Netherlands where I teach the next generation of digital designers about designing things for the web, technically and aesthetically. Sometimes I give workshops to design teams about working together to create better websites. You should ask me to give one of those workshops at your company.

**E:** Before this, I managed the design team at Redink (now HyperRedink), where I worked with clients like Santander, DNB, Oslo Municipality, and Elkjøp. 

**V:** I write about the Web, about web design and about web development on this blog, in the paper edition of the Dutch Web Designer Magazine, and occasionally on Smashing Magazine. Together with Peet Sneekes I host an irregular video podcast about the web, design and content, called De Wasstraat. I write about nonsense on my slightly neglected blog Love Nonsense. I’m busy, but lazy as well. So I ordered my server to generate books and prints for me. Yes, they are for sale.
